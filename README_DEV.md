openseadragon-annotations
=========================
I have set up a testing environment for local development using Python/Flask

To run this code, first make sure your python environment has Flask available, I am using the Anaconda Python Distribution

Then cd into the dev_testing/ directory and type python app.py

Then open your local browser to localhost:5002  (Port can be changed in the app.py if desired)

I am currently only testing this in Google Chrome

#Create Python Environment
conda create --name osd-annotations flask
source activate osd-annotations




#Requirements
For now I am linking to the OSD 2.1.0 src on GitHub
